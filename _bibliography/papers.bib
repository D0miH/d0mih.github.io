  abstract = 	 {Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received a lot of interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from text only. 
  However, achieving one-shot generation that aligns with the user’s intent is nearly impossible, yet small changes to the input prompt often result 
  in very different images. This leaves the user with little semantic control. To put the user in control, we show how to interact with the diffusion 
  process to flexibly steer it along semantic directions. This semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any generative architecture using classifier-free 
  guidance. More importantly, it allows for subtle and extensive edits, composition and style changes, and optimizing the overall artistic conception. We 
  demonstrate SEGA’s effectiveness on both latent and pixel-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Paella, and DeepFloyd-IF using a variety of tasks, 
  thus providing strong evidence for its versatility and flexibility.},

  title = { Combining AI and AM – Improving Approximate Matching through Transformer Networks },
  abstract = 	 {Approximate matching (AM) is a concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts. 
  An important use case of AM is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist, if only 
  fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital 
  forensic investigation, the AM algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted malware. However, traditional 
  AM functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared 
  to the overall file size. A second well-known issue with traditional AM algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing 
  lookup databases. We propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer models from the field of natural language processing. 
  We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence (AI), DLAM gets knowledge of 
  characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, 
  that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent 
  conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary 
  until now before any search for them with AM algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is 
  important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar or even 
  significantly higher accuracy in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations 
  in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for small fragment sizes.},

  abstract = 	 {The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. 
  One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. 
  Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. 
  We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. 
  Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. 
  Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. 
  Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.},

  impossible through manual inspection. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that enables model training on potentially poisoned datasets by 
  utilizing the power of recent diffusion models. Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of 
  diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data. By combining this generative approach with knowledge distillation, we produce student models that

  abstract = {While text-to-image synthesis currently enjoys great popularity among researchers and the general public, the security of these models has been neglected so far. 
  Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. 
  Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. 
  Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin 
  character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. 
  We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. 
  Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.},

  replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we

  The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. 
  Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. 
  Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned 
  to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need 
  for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.},

  rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to 
  produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked 
  than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, 
  making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.},

Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system’s reliability. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. 
Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, 
forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, 
inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective.},
