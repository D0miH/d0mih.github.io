My research focuses on the privacy and security of deep learning systems. As deep learning increasingly powers real-world applications, the data used to train these models becomes ever more critical. Many of these applications require models to be both reliable and secure, particularly when sensitive data, such as medical records or personal images, is involved in the training process.
In my work, I investigate potential threats to the safety and security of deep learning models and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

I received my Masters from TU Darmstadt and I am currenctly a PhD student at TU Darmstadt and the German Research Center for AI (DFKI) under the supervision of <a href='https://ml-research.github.io/people/kkersting/index.html'>Prof. Kristian Kersting</a>.
