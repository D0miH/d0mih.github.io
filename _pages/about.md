My research is centered around the privacy and security of deep learning systems. As deep learning is increasingly used in real-world products and tasks, the data to train such systems is getting more and more relevant and important. In many of those tasks, the models have to be reliable and secure since during training, sensitive data might have been used, such as medical information or other personal data like for example images. In my work, I study possible threats and mitigation techniques to the security and privacy of deep learning models.

I received by Masters from TU Darmstadt and am a PhD student under the supervision of <a href='https://ml-research.github.io/people/kkersting/index.html'>Prof. Kristian Kersting</a> since 2021.
