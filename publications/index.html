One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names and faces of individuals from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors into text encoders, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person’s actual name. For image encoders, we map embeddings of individuals to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JAIR</abbr></div> <div id="hintersdorf2024clip_privacy" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Does CLIP Know My Face?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Lukas Struppek, Manuel Brack, Felix Friedrich, Patrick Schramowski, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">SeT LLM</abbr></div> <div id="struppek2024adversarialllm" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Exploring the Adversarial Capabilities of Large Language Models </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, Minh Hieu Le, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In ICLR 2024 Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models (SeT LLM) </em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09132" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/LukasStruppek/Exploiting-Cultural-Biases-via-Homoglyphs" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has sparked widespread and general interest due to their strong language generation capabilities, offering great potential for both industry and research. While previous research delved into the security and privacy issues of LLMs, the extent to which these models can exhibit adversarial behavior remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp. attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">DPFM</abbr></div> <div id="struppek2024homoglyphs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Exploiting Cultural Biases via Homoglyphs in Text-to-Image Synthesis </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Felix Friedrich, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

They are capable of producing high-quality images that depict a variety of concepts and styles when conditioned on textual descriptions. However, these models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent. We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in the textual description, common models reflect cultural biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify a model’s text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Such behavior can be interpreted as a model feature, offering users a simple way to customize the image generation and reflect their own cultural background. Yet, malicious users or service providers may also try to intentionally bias the image generation. One goal might be to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="struppek23smoothing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Be Careful What You Smooth For: Label Smoothing Can Be a Privacy Shield but Also a Catalyst for Model Inversion Attacks </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations </em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1SbkubNdbW" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/LukasStruppek/Plug-and-Play-Attacks" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Label smoothing – using softened labels instead of hard ones – is a widely adopted regularization method for deep learning, showing diverse benefits such as enhanced generalization and calibration. Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks (MIAs), which aim to generate class-representative samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model’s privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses.

However, achieving one-shot generation that aligns with the user’s intent is nearly impossible, yet small changes to the input prompt often result in very different images. This leaves the user with little semantic control. To put the user in control, we show how to interact with the diffusion process to flexibly steer it along semantic directions. This semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any generative architecture using classifier-free guidance. More importantly, it allows for subtle and extensive edits, composition and style changes, and optimizing the overall artistic conception. We demonstrate SEGA’s effectiveness on both latent and pixel-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Paella, and DeepFloyd-IF using a variety of tasks, thus providing strong evidence for its versatility and flexibility.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">DFRWS</abbr></div> <div id="uhlig2022dlam" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Combining AI and AM – Improving Approximate Matching through Transformer Networks </div> <div class="author"> *Frieder Uhlig, *Lukas Struppek, <em>*Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Thomas Göbel, Harald Baier, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

An important use case of AM is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist, if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic investigation, the AM algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted malware. However, traditional AM functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size. A second well-known issue with traditional AM algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases. We propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer models from the field of natural language processing. We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence (AI), DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with AM algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar or even significantly higher accuracy in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for small fragment sizes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">BUGS</abbr></div> <div id="hintersdorf23defendingbugs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Defending Our Privacy With Backdoors </div> <div class="author"> <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Lukas Struppek, Daniel Neider, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Backdoors in Deep Learning </em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08320.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/D0miH/Defending-Our-Privacy-With-Backdoors" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns.

Such backdoors remain silent during inference on clean inputs, evading detection due to inconspicuous behavior. However, once a specific trigger pattern appears in the input data, the backdoor activates, causing the model to execute its concealed function. Detecting such poisoned samples within vast datasets is virtually impossible through manual inspection. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that enables model training on potentially poisoned datasets by utilizing the power of recent diffusion models. Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data. By combining this generative approach with knowledge distillation, we produce student models that maintain their general performance on the task while exhibiting robust resistance to backdoor triggers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">arXiv</abbr></div> <div id="struppek23caia" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Class Attribute Inference Attacks: Inferring Sensitive Class Information by Diffusion-Based Attribute Manipulations </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Felix Friedrich, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

To investigate this privacy leakage, we introduce the first Class Attribute Inference Attack (Caia), which leverages recent advances in text-to-image synthesis to infer sensitive attributes of individual classes in a black-box setting, while remaining competitive with related white-box attacks. Our extensive experiments in the face recognition domain show that Caia can accurately infer undisclosed sensitive attributes, such as an individual’s hair color, gender and racial appearance, which are not part of the training labels. Interestingly, we demonstrate that adversarial robust models are even more vulnerable to such privacy leakage than standard models, indicating that a trade-off between robustness and privacy exists.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">arXiv</abbr></div> <div id="friedrich23fair" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Fair Diffusion: Instructing Text-to-Image Generation Models on Fairness </div> <div class="author"> Felix Friedrich, Manuel Brack, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Lukas Struppek, Patrick Schramowski, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

However, since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the internet, they also suffer from degenerated and biased human behavior, as we demonstrate. In fact, they may even reinforce such biases. To not only uncover but also combat these undesired effects, we present a novel strategy, called Fair Diffusion, to attenuate biases after the deployment of generative text-to-image models. Specifically, we demonstrate shifting a bias, based on human instructions, in any direction yielding arbitrarily new proportions for, e.g., identity groups. As our empirical evaluation demonstrates, this introduced control enables instructing generative image models on fairness, with no data filtering and additional training required.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICCV</abbr></div> <div id="struppek23iccv" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Rickrolling the Artist: Injecting Backdoors into Text Encoders for Text-to-Image Synthesis </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 19th IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02408.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/lukasstruppek/rickrolling-the-artist" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>While text-to-image synthesis currently enjoys great popularity among researchers and the general public, the security of these models has been neglected so far. Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JAIR</abbr></div> <div id="struppek23exploiting" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Exploiting Cultural Biases via Homoglyphs in Text-to-Image Synthesis </div> <div class="author"> Lukas Struppek, <em>Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Felix Friedrich, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

These models are capable of producing high-quality images that depict a variety of concepts and styles when conditioned on textual descriptions. However, these models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent. We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in a textual description, common models reflect cultural stereotypes and biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify a model’s text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Additionally, malicious users or service providers may try to intentionally bias the image generation to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making it robust against homoglyph manipulations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ConPro</abbr></div> <div id=" Best Paper Award at ConPro 2022 " class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title"> Investigating the Risks of Client-Side Scanning for the Use Case NeuralHash </div> <div class="author"> <em>*Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, *Lukas Struppek, Daniel Neider, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 6th Workshop on Technology and Consumer Protection @ IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy </em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2022/ConPro/papers/hintersdorf-conpro22.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ml-research/Learning-to-Break-Deep-Perceptual-Hashing" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Large, text-conditioned generative diffusion models have recently gained a lot of attention for their impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images from text alone.

Previous research has developed generative MIAs that use generative adversarial networks (GANs) as image priors tailored to a specific target model. This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug &amp; Play Attacks, which relax the dependency between the target model and image prior, and enable the use of a single GAN to attack a wide range of targets, requiring only minor adjustments to the attack. Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, for which previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results. Our extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and flexibility of Plug &amp; Play Attacks and their ability to create high-quality images revealing sensitive class characteristics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IJCAI</abbr></div> <div id="hintersdorf22toTrust" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">To Trust or Not To Trust Prediction Scores for Membership Inference Attacks</div> <div class="author"> <em>*Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, *Lukas Struppek, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09076.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ml-research/to-trust-or-not-to-trust-prediction-scores-for-membership-inference-attacks" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific sample was used to train a predictive model. Knowing this may indeed lead to a privacy breach. Most MIAs, however, make use of the model’s prediction scores - the probability of each output given some input - following the intuition that the trained model tends to behave differently on its training data. We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">FAccT</abbr></div> <div id="struppek22learning" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning to Break Deep Perceptual Hashing: The Use Case NeuralHash</div> <div class="author"> *Lukas Struppek, <em>*Dominik Hintersdorf</em>, Daniel Neider, and Kristian Kersting</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06628.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ml-research/Learning-to-Break-Deep-Perceptual-Hashing" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before files are uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system’s reliability. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Dominik Hintersdorf.
